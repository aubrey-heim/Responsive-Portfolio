## About the Project
This project is the second homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I was given photos of three pages: an index, a portfolio, and a contact page. Each of these pages were pictured at a width of 400px, 768px, and 992px. I created HTML files based on these photos, with my personal information. 

### Bootstrap and Responsive Design
For this project, I used the Bootstrap CSS framework. This framework helped be to construct a collapsing navigation bar for the page. Additionally, it helped me to set up pages that would be responsive to various screen widths. As you can see, the example photos provided were set up quite differently based on the width of the screen in use. Through the use of the Bootstrap grid system, my rows and columns could be adjusted based on the size of the screen. This was accomplished through use of the "col-sm", "col-md", "col-lg" classes which Bootstrap has provided. Additionally, I made the portfolio photos responsive as well by setting their width as a percentage of the screen size. After setting up the layout of the page using Bootstrap, I was able to customize the aesthetics through my own CSS file. 

### HTML Validation
Once the pages were built for the site, I ran them through an HTML Validator. The validator flagged any syntax errors found in my code, so that I could go back and fix them. Through using the validator, I was able to verify that my code was clean and free of syntax errors.

## Benefits of This Project
There were several key things that I learned while completing this project. First, I gained experience with a CSS framework. This time working with Bootstrap taught me a lot. I was able to discover some of the benefits and drawbacks of using a framework. A lot of the benefits lie in the use of the provided class names (such as using my- or mx- when needing a margin). Using these classes helped to save a lot of time in writing my own CSS. However, I did run into the drawback of attempting to override the framework's CSS. This could be difficult at times. However, this gave me priceless experience in troubleshooting and I learned a lot about which types of selectors are prioritized (for instance, and ID selector overrides a class selector). I also gained a lot of practice working with a grid-system to design these pages. The gride system is incredibly helpful in building responsive pages.
