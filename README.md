## About the Project
This project is the eighth homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I needed to update my portfolio with examples of my work thus far, as well as my contact information. I also worked to update my professional online presence and resume. This project is an update of the second homework assignment from the UW Coding Bootcamp. That assignment was maintained in the "homework2" branch of this repository: https://github.com/aubrey-heim/portfolio/tree/homework2.

## Benefits of This Project
Updating this portfolio gave me the opportunity to explore what I am able to create using my own imagination. I was able to explore my creativity to make the page as I wanted it. I explored tools available to me and found resources to create a coordinated color palette, gradients, and background images to suit my needs. I was able to practice with making applications mobile-first and responsive. This assignment also gave me the opportunity to better my online presence and portfolio. It has been very helpful to make these conform to industry standards.
